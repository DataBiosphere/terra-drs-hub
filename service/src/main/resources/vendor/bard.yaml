    A lightweight service to handle tracking user and api events in a compliant

  /api/event:
    post:
      summary: Log a user event
      tags: [ bard ]
      description: >-
        Records the event to a log and optionally forwards it to mixpanel.
        Optionally takes an authorization token which must be verified with Sam.
        If properties['pushToMixpanel'] is false, only log the event (the property defaults to true).
        The logs will still get sent to BigQuery via a log sink.

  /api/identify:
    post:
      summary: Merge two user id's
      tags: [ bard ]
      description: >-
        Calls MixPanel's `$identify` endpoint to merge the included
        distinct_ids. This merges the client generated id, used for anonymous,
        non-authenticated metrics with the Bard auto-generated `distinct_id` to
        link an anonymous session with a user. Requires an authorization token
        that is verified with Sam
      operationId: identify
      requestBody:
        required: true

  /api/syncProfile:
    post:
      summary: Update mixpanel profile
      tags: [ bard ]
      description: >-
        Syncs profile info from orchestration to mixpanel. Requires an
        authorization token, which pulls the corresponding profile from
        Orchestration to sync into mixpanel
